CellProfiler has 14 main modules:

    MeasureColocalization
    MeasureGranularity
    MeasureImageAreaOccupied
    MeasureImageIntensity
    MeasureImageOverlap
    MeasureImageQuality
    MeasureImageSkeleton
    MeasureObjectIntensity
    MeasureObjectIntensityDistribution
    MeasureObjectNeighbors

Each module returns dozens of features; more if looking at combinations of
images/objects

Features are named in the following format:
MeasurementType_Category_SpecificFeatureName_Parameters
Cells_Texture_DifferenceVariance_GFP_8_00
  > MeasurementType: Cells
  > Category: Texture (MeasureTexture module used)
  > SpecificFeatureName: DifferenceVariance

                 was measured)
  > Parameter 2: 8 (???)
  > Parameter 3: 00 (???)

Cell Features
> cell_id: unique id assigned to each single cell
> ORF: what gene has been deleted/made temp. sensitive
       in that cell
> Name: ORF name
> Allele: ORF allele
> Strain ID: unique ID for each ORF
  >> It's unique to each ORF, not across markers
     (i.e., NUR1 strain has the same strain ID
     for Om45 and Pil1)
  >> Can use this to subset all cells belonging to same
     strain per marker
> Plate/Row/Column: coordinates where cell was found
> ImageNumber/ObjectNumber: 4 images taken from each
                            well, with certain number
                            of ojbects (cells) found
                            in those images


AreaShape: MeasureObjectSizeShape
  > Area: (2D only) The number of pixels in the region
  > Compactness: (2D only) The mean squared distance of the object’s pixels from
                 the centroid divided by the area
    >> A filled circle will have a compactness of 1, with irregular objects or
       objects with holes having a value greater than 1
  > Eccentricity: (2D only) The eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same
    second-moments as the region
    >> The eccentricity is the ratio of the distance between the foci of the
       ellipse and its major axis length
    >> The value is between 0 and 1 (an ellipse whose eccentricity is 0 is
       actually a circle, while an ellipse whose eccentricity is 1 is a line
       segment)
  > Extent: The proportion of the pixels (2D) or voxels (3D) in the bounding box
    that are also in the region
    >> Computed as the area/volume of the object divided by the area/volume of
       the bounding box
  > FormFactor: (2D only) Calculated as 4*π*Area/Perimeter^2
    >> Equals 1 for a perfectly circular object
  > MajorAxisLength: The length (in pixels) of the major axis of the ellipse
    that has the same normalized second central moments as the region
  > MinFeretDiameter, MaxFeretDiameter: (2D only) The Feret diameter is the
    distance between two parallel lines tangent on either side of the object
    (imagine taking a caliper and measuring the object at various angles)
    >> The minimum and maximum Feret diameters are the smallest and largest
       possible diameters, rotating the calipers along all possible angles
  > MaximumRadius: (2D only) The maximum distance of any pixel in the object to
    the closest pixel outside of the object
    >> For skinny objects, this is 1/2 of the maximum width of the object
  > MeanRadius: (2D only) The mean distance of any pixel in the object to the
    closest pixel outside of the object
  > MedianRadius: (2D only) The median distance of any pixel in the object to
    the closest pixel outside of the object
  > MinorAxisLength: The length (in pixels) of the minor axis of the ellipse
    that has the same normalized second central moments as the region
  > Perimeter: (2D only) The total number of pixels around the boundary of each
    region in the image
  > Solidity: The proportion of the pixels in the convex hull that are also in
    the object, i.e., ObjectArea/ConvexHullArea
  > Zernike shape features: (2D only) These metrics of shape describe a binary
    object (or more precisely, a patch with background and an object in the
    center) in a basis of Zernike polynomials, using the coefficients as
    features
    >> Currently, Zernike polynomials from order 0 to order 9 are calculated,
       giving in total 30 measurements
    >> While there is no limit to the order which can be calculated (and indeed
       you could add more by adjusting the code), the higher order polynomials
       carry less information

Granularity: MeasureGranularity
  > Granularity: higher the value, higher the quality

Intensity: MeasureObjectIntensity
  > IntegratedIntensityEdge: The sum of the edge pixel intensities of an object
  > IntegratedIntensity: The sum of the pixel intensities within an object
  > LowerQuartileIntensity: The intensity value of the pixel for which 25% of
    the pixels in the object have lower values
  > MADIntensity: The median absolute deviation (MAD) value of the intensities within the object
    >> The MAD is defined as the median(|xi - median(x)|)
  > MassDisplacement: The distance between the centers of gravity in the
    gray-level representation of the object and the binary representation of the
    object
  > MaxIntensityEdge: The maximal edge pixel intensity of an object
  > MaxIntensity: The maximal pixel intensity within an object
  > MeanIntensityEdge: The average edge pixel intensity of an object
  > MeanIntensity: The average pixel intensity within an object
  > MedianIntensity: The median intensity value within the object
  > MinIntensityEdge: The minimal edge pixel intensity of an object
  > MinIntensity: The minimal pixel intensity within an object
  > StdIntensityEdge: The standard deviation of the edge pixel intensities of an
    object
  > StdIntensity: The standard deviation of the pixel intensities within an
    object
  > UpperQuartileIntensity: The intensity value of the pixel for which 75% of
    the pixels in the object have lower values
  > MinIntensityEdge: The minimal edge pixel intensity of an object

RadialDistribution: MeasureObjectIntensityDistribution
  > FracAtD: Fraction of total stain in an object at a given radius
  > MeanFrac: Mean fractional intensity at a given radius; calculated as
    fraction of total intensity normalized by fraction of pixels at a given
    radius
  > RadialCV: Coefficient of variation of intensity within a ring, calculated
    across 8 slices
  > Zernike: The Zernike features characterize the distribution of intensity
    across the object
    >> For instance, Zernike 1,1 has a high value if the intensity is low on one
       side of the object and high on the other
    >> The ZernikeMagnitude feature records the rotationally invariant degree
       magnitude of the moment and the ZernikePhase feature gives the moment’s
       orientation

Texture: MeasureTexture
  > AngularSecondMoment: Measure of image homogeneity
    >> A higher value of this feature indicates that the intensity varies less
       in an image
    >> Has a value of 1 for a uniform image
  > Contrast: Measure of local variation in an image, with 0 for a uniform image
    and a high value indicating a high degree of local variation
  > Correlation: Measure of linear dependency of intensity values in an image
    >> For an image with large areas of similar intensities, correlation is much
       higher than for an image with noisier, uncorrelated intensities
    >> Has a value of 1 or -1 for a perfectly positively or negatively
       correlated image, respectively
  > DifferenceEntropy: Another indication of the amount of randomness in an
    image
  > DifferenceVariance: The image variation in a normalized co-occurrence matrix
  > Entropy: An indication of the complexity within an image
    >> A complex image produces a high entropy value
  > InfoMeas1: A measure of the total amount of information contained within a
    region of pixels derived from the recurring spatial relationship between
    specific intensity values
  > InfoMeas2: An additional measure of the total amount of information
    contained within a region of pixels derived from the recurring spatial
    relationship between specific intensity values
    >> It is a complementary value to InfoMeas1 and is on a different scale
  > InverseDifferenceMoment: Another feature to represent image contrast
    >> Has a low value for inhomogeneous images, and a relatively higher value
       for homogeneous images
  > SumAverage: The average of the normalized grayscale image in the spatial
    domain
  > SumEntropy: A measure of randomness within an image
  > SumVariance: The variance of the normalized grayscale image in the spatial
    domain
  > Variance: Measure of the variation of image intensity values
    >> For an image with uniform intensity, the texture variance would be zero
